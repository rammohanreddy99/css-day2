              <hr />
              <p>
                Koduri Srisaila Sri Rajamouli was born on 10 October 1973 in a Telugu family to
                V. Vijayendra Prasad and Raja Nandini.His parents were staying in Hire Kotnekal 
                in Raichur district of Mysore state (present-day Karnataka) at the time of his birth.
                Both his parents hail from Andhra Pradesh — his father from Kovvur near Rajahmundry
                and his mother from Visakhapatnam.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rajamouli's parents are ardent devotees of Lord Shiva. He was born after his mother
                had a dream when she visited the pilgrimage site of Srisailam. Hence, he was named 
                Srisaila Sri Rajamouli.He has one elder sister who now lives in Australia. Rajamouli 
                grew up in a joint family — his father and his five brothers lived in the same house 
                with their families.Prasad's family had lands in Kovvur, which were lost
                when the railways lines were laid through them.  Then, Prasad and his family moved
                to Karnataka from Kovvur in 1968. Prasad, along with his elder brother K. V. Sivashankar,
                bought seven acres of paddy fields in Hirekotikal village near Manvi in Raichur district. 
                Their family moved back to Kovvur in 1977.Rajamouli was educated in Kovvur till fourth
                standard and then shifted to Eluru where he studied till Intermediate first year. He then 
                took a break of two years and finished his Intermediate second year in Kovvur. After that,
                he did not pursue any further formal education.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rajamouli was passionate about storytelling right from his second standard.When he was
                seven years old, his grandmother introduced him to the epics Ramayana, Mahabharata, and
                Bhagavata.At the same age, his father introduced him to Amar Chitra Katha comics that
                featured stories on Indian historical figures, religious legends and folktales. It had a 
                huge impact on him and developed his penchant for larger-than-life characters.He would 
                remember those stories and the films he watched and then re-tell them to his friends in
                his own way. His mother was keen on him learning English and would take him
                to watch English-language films in the nearby towns. She encouraged him to read comics and 
                storybooks in his free time and never pressured him in academics.His father recollecting 
                about Rajamouli's childhood noted, "he was not an ambitious child. For a long time, we did
                not know what interested him. He showed some inclination towards films. He played the role of
                young Krishna in a film I directed."
              </p>

              <hr />
              <p>
                Rajamouli married Rama, sister-in-law of his cousin Keeravani in 2001. After their marriage, 
                Rama worked as a costume designer for many of Rajamouli's films. He adopted Karthikeya, Rama's 
                son from her previous marriage. The couple also has an adopted daughter Mayookha. Karthikeya is
                married to Pooja Prasad, niece of Telugu actor Jagapathi Babu.
                Rajamouli's cousin, M. M. Keeravani has worked as the music composer for all of his films.
                His other cousins Kalyani Malik and M. M. Srilekha are also music composers. S. S. Kanchi, 
                a screenwriter and actor known for his role in the sitcom Amrutham is also one of his cousins.
                He collaborated with Rajamouli as a script doctor on many of his films and also acted in four of 
                his films.Raja Koduri, an Executive vice-president at Intel is also a cousin of his.Rajamouli considers
                K. Raghavendra Rao as his guru and mentor.He called Gunnam Gangaraju his philosopher and guide who made
                an impact on his worldview.

              <h4 class="l1"><u>Film Making Style</u></h4>
              <hr />
              <p>
                A self confessed "film freak",Rajamouli's penchant for filmmaking is best captured by the word
                "emotion". He has often stated that his films are based on stories driven by human emotions. Revenge is a
                recurring theme in his films. 
              </p>
              <p>
                While scaling up his work with "larger-than-life" themes over the years, Rajamouli maintained his signature 
                style of filmmaking that allows audiences to simmer in the thrills and emotions of the story with less dialogue.
                All his films end with a print of his trademark circular stamp stating: "an S. S. Rajamouli film".
              </p>
              <p>
                Film critic Baradwaj Rangan opined that Rajamouli is a "great storyteller" who takes up common concepts and develops
                them in a novel acceptable way.Production designer Sabu Cyril, a four-time National Award winner for Best Art 
                Direction and who worked for the Baahubali duology, said his team came up with as many as 25,000 sketches to design
                the various grand sets for the film in order to satisfy the rigorous visualisation standards of Rajamouli, which were
                grand and at the same time gone into very minute details ensuring that every pillar and wall had the right design.
                Cyril said, "Rajamouli makes no compromises."
